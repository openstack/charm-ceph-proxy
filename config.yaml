options:
  loglevel:
    default: 1
    type: int
    description: Mon and OSD debug level. Max is 20.
  fsid:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      fsid of the ceph cluster. To generate a suitable value use `uuid`
      .
      This configuration element is mandatory and the service will fail on
      install if it is not provided.
  auth-supported:
    type: string
    default: cephx
    description: |
      Which authentication flavour to use.
      .
      Valid options are "cephx" and "none".  If "none" is specified,
      keys will still be created and deployed so that it can be
      enabled later.
  monitor-secret:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This value will become the mon. key. To generate a suitable value use:
      .
        ceph-authtool /dev/stdout --name=mon. --gen-key
      .
      This configuration element is mandatory and the service will fail on
      install if it is not provided.
  monitor-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      How many nodes to wait for before trying to create the monitor cluster
      this number needs to be odd, and more than three is a waste except for
      very large clusters.
  source:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support use of additional sources such as:

        - ppa:myteam/ppa
        - cloud:trusty-proposed/kilo
        - http://my.archive.com/ubuntu main

      The last option should be used in conjunction with the key configuration
      option.

      Note that a minimum ceph version of 0.48.2 is required for use with this
      charm which is NOT provided by the packages in the main Ubuntu archive
      for precise but is provided in the Ubuntu cloud archive.
  key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Key ID to import to the apt keyring to support use with arbitary source
      configuration from outside of Launchpad archives or PPA's.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If set to True, supporting services will log to syslog.
  ceph-public-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the public (front-side) network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
  ceph-cluster-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the cluster (back-side) network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.

      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  sysctl:
    type: string
    default: '{ kernel.pid_max : 2097152, vm.max_map_count : 524288,
                kernel.threads-max: 2097152 }'
    description: |
      YAML-formatted associative array of sysctl key/value pairs to be set
      persistently. By default we set pid_max, max_map_count and 
      threads-max to a high value to avoid problems with large numbers (>20)
      of OSDs recovering. very large clusters should set those values even
      higher (e.g. max for kernel.pid_max is 4194303).
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
